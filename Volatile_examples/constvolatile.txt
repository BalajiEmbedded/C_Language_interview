What is const volatile?

const volatile means:
The program must NOT modify the variable,
but the value can change externally (hardware / ISR).

const → your code cannot write
volatile → compiler must always read from memory

const volatile is used for variables that are read-only for software but 
whose values can change due to hardware or external events."

examples:-“I used const volatile for read-only hardware status registers 
like ADC status or UART status registers.”

ADC data registers are modified by hardware but should not be written by software,
 so they are declared const volatile.”

Used const volatile when data is written by ISR but read-only in application code
