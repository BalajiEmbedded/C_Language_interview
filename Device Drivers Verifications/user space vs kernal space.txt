user space vs kernal space

User space → Applications
Kernel space → OS core + drivers

Real example
User space crash
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
Only app dies.

Driver crash
Kernel panic - not syncing
Entire system dies.

How you debug driver crash
After reboot:

journalctl -k -b -1

Output:
Call Trace:
 my_driver_write
 vfs_write
 
journalctl is used to see the system logs at one place 
system logs (kernel, services, drivers, boot logs) in one place.

journalctl -e -> jump to the end of the logs
journalctl -f -> live monitoring of logs
journalctl -k -> only kernal logs (device drivers, kernal panics, hardware issues)

logs for specific service:-

journalctl -u ssh
journalctl -u NetworkManager

journalctl -b -> logs since last boot

journalctl --since "10 minutes ago"
journalctl --since "2026-01-06 18:00:00"
