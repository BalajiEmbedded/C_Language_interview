What is Device driver:-

Device driver is a piece of code that act as a bridge between the os & hardware 
os talks software language, drivers converts the software language into hardware specific actions

Why device drivers are needed ?

OS cannot directly control hardware
Every hardware device works differently
Driver hides hardware complexity
Provides a standard interface to OS

lsmod | grep usb

-> usbcore   299008  6 xhci_hcd,usb_storage

This means:

USB driver is loaded

OS can talk to USB devices


dmesg | tail 
usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -110

Meaning:

Driver tried to talk to USB device

Hardware didn’t respond (timeout)


lsmod -> it lists all the currently loaded kernal modules

lsmod

Module          Size    Used by
i2c_dev         20480   0
snd_hda_intel   57344   3
usbcore         286720  5


When you use lsmod

Check if a driver is already loaded

Debug device not working

Verify after inserting/removing a module
